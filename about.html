    <p class="about1"><span>After the creation of the Call Me Campaign (&lt;&lt;include link), our community consortium felt inspired to continue the conversation and further the attention on the harm stigma can have in our community. From that inspiration, the Call Me Documentary was created.</span></p>
    <p class="about2"><span>The Call Me Documentary provides first-person accounts of five local, North Idaho residents as they share their stories of recovery. Commentary from two professionals working in substance use disorder further the message that addiction is a disease and the hope of recovery is possible.</span></p>
    <p class="about3"><span>Together, as a north Idaho community, we can change our language and actions to make this a recovery friendly place.</span></p>
